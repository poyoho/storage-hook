storage-hook ensures that the original type of js (String / Boolean / Number / Date / Object / Array) is stable in storage (localStorage, sessionStorage and more).

## Installing

Using npm:

```sh
$ npm install @poyoho/storage-hook
```

Using yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add @poyoho/storage-hook
```

Using unpkg CDN:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@poyoho/storage-hook/dist/storage-hook.iife.js"></script>
```

## Example

`useLocalStorage` create a type stable localstorage object.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string
}

const ls = useLocalStorage({
  key1: Boolean,
  key2: Number,
  key3: String,
  user: Object as unknown as User
})
```

and then we can use localstorage api and had the expect type.

```ts
const key1 = ls.getItem('key1')
// must be boolean or not will throw a promise error
key1

ls.setItem('key1', true)
```

### about deep object

But there is no way to ensure the type of Object after ts coercion (e.g. `interface User` in this example).

we don't traverse the object to make the object type stable.

```ts
const user = ls.getItem('key4')
// not necessarily exist and type not necessarily be string
user.name
```

Provide two ideasï¼š

1. flat user object by new storage.

```ts
const user = useLocalStorage({
  name: String
  age: Number
})
```

2. validate by yourself.
